/**
 * The two ways into a skill's detail panel, and the card label in front of them.
 *
 * The screen flow names both — a card click, and `Scope…` on the row menu — and
 * says there is no `Details` entry beside them because the card click is the way
 * in. They must open the **same** thing: two pieces of state here is how one
 * entry point comes to open a stale row while the other opens the live one.
 *
 * The card's reach label is asserted in the same file because it is the claim the
 * panel behind it can contradict. Before the host reported the scope the card
 * said "available for your agents to read" unconditionally, which is false for
 * exactly the companies that bothered to scope.
