/**
 * Issue #1469: the commonest repair outcome opened a dialog that denied itself.
 *
 * `duplicate_folder_plan` leaves any group holding a *file* entirely alone and
 * reports every member as `fileSharesTheName` — so a note and a folder both
 * called `Specs` yields **zero** folds and two residuals. The dialog then
 * announced "0 folders share a name", drew an empty fold list, filed the
 * residuals under "These will be left for you" as if they were the leftovers of
 * work that had happened, and offered a permanently disabled "Merge 0".
 *
 * These pin the branch: the residual-only outcome is now the thing the dialog
 * is about, every row carries its real kind and its path, and the footer has an
 * action that can actually be pressed.
