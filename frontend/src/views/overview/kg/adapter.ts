// Our host's data, shaped into the knowledge graph's five-ring org model.
//
// ## What is real, and what is not
//
// The graph reads `company → department → SOP task → the worker who does it →
// that worker's tools`. This host serves only some of those edges:
//
// | Edge                | Source                        | Real? |
// |---------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
// | task → worker       | `task.assignee` on the board  | yes   |
// | category → skill    | `skill.category`              | yes   |
// | server → tool       | what the server advertises    | yes   |
// | teammate → department | `GET {scope}/desks`         | yes   |
// | worker → tools      | nothing (`[tools] allow` is company-wide) | **derived** |
// | department → workflow | nothing (no flow API yet)   | **derived** |
//
// Ring 1 used to be invented too: `assignDepartment` keyword-matched a role
// string into one of five hardcoded buckets, falling back to Operations. It is
// gone (issue #486). A desk — a `[[group_chat]]` or an operator-created overlay
// desk — is the one place the company actually declares how it is organised, so
// the departments are its desks and a teammate's department is the desk they
// are seated on.
//
// The consequence is that the graph now has to answer a question the invention
// let it dodge: **what about somebody the company declares no desk for?** They
// are not placed — see `UNPLACED`. Nothing here invents a position for anyone.
//
// The two remaining derived edges are placeholders: there is no per-agent tool
// list and no flow API. `DERIVED_NOTICE` is the standing caveat. As each lands
// upstream, delete the matching helper (or `WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES`) and read the
// real value straight through.
