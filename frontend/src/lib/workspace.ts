// folders and markdown notes that lives on the **host**, in the company's
// `WorkspaceStore`. The console reads and writes it over the `…/workspace`
// routes in `@/api/workspace`; the company's agents read and write the same
// tree through their workspace tools, so operator and agents share one surface.
//
// Nothing here persists anything. These are the derivations the view needs on
// top of a tree it has already fetched (ordering, ancestry, wiki-link title
// resolution). The one localStorage touch left is the *migration* pair at the
// bottom, which exists solely to rescue notes typed into the retired
// client-side scratchpad and is expected to become a no-op once every browser
// has been through it once.
