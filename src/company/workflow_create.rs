//! Feature-free core for authoring a new workflow graph (issue #112).
//!
//! [`create_company_workflow`] is the single validated-persist sequence for
//! creating a workflow graph, shared by **both** the console's
//! `POST …/workflows` route and the orchestrator's `create_workflow` tool so
//! they run exactly the same checks and land the exact same artifact — no
//! create-vs-run drift, one place to reason about safety.
//!
//! The graph body is persisted **on the company record** as an
//! [`OverlayWorkflow`], never written into the company source tree. The source
//! tree is the version-controlled seed and, in hosted mode, a read-only crate
//! mount — writing there failed every hosted tenant with `EROFS` (issue #168).
//! Readers union the two sources via
//! [`load_workflow_union`](crate::company::load_workflow_union), with the seed
//! file winning on an id collision.
//!
//! The sequence, in order, each step an actionable error before anything is
//! persisted:
//!
//! 1. the id is a safe filename stem (no slashes / `..`) and within length caps
//!    — it is still an id a seed file could carry, so the two sources stay
//!    interchangeable;
//! 2. the graph is within the node/edge size caps (a runaway graph can't be
//!    persisted);
//! 3. it names exactly one `trigger` (a freshly authored graph must say what
//!    starts it — stricter than [`parse_workflow`], which allows many);
//! 4. every `agent` node names a real roster teammate (manifest ∪ overlay);
//! 5. its id is unique against the company's seed ids ∪ overlay ids ∪
//!    manifest-enabled ids (a [`Conflict`](OpenCompanyError::Conflict));
//! 6. its display name is unique (case-insensitive) against the company's
//!    existing seed + overlay + manifest-enabled workflows;
//! 7. the rendered TOML re-parses through [`parse_workflow`] (the same
//!    structural validation a hand-authored file passes) and is within the byte
//!    cap;
//! 8. the body **and** the enabled id are pushed onto the record and persisted
//!    in **one** [`save`](CompanyStore::save) — a single atomic write, so there
//!    is no half-created state to roll back;
//! 9. a best-effort [`WorkflowCreated`](CompanyEvent::WorkflowCreated) audit
//!    event is journaled — never rolling the create back if the journal fails.
//!
//! Steps 4–8 run under the per-company [`company_write_lock`] so a concurrent
//! `create_workflow` (tool) and `POST …/workflows` (REST) can never clobber
//! each other's `overlay`/`enabled` write, the same primitive `add_agent` uses.
//! That lock is what makes the id-uniqueness check of step 5 atomic now that
//! the filesystem's `create_new(true)` no longer serializes the two surfaces.
//!
//! Compiled in the default build (no harness imports) so the REST route reaches
//! it without any feature gate.
//!
//! # Editing and removing (issue #259)
//!
//! [`update_company_workflow`] and [`delete_company_workflow`] complete the
//! write lifecycle. Both run the same validation and hold the same
//! [`company_write_lock`] as create, and both are **overlay-only**: they refuse
//! (with a [`Conflict`](OpenCompanyError::Conflict)) to touch an id backed by a
//! seed file or by a bodiless manifest-`enabled` entry. That is not squeamishness
//! about writing to disk, it is the only shape that is honest about what the
//! reader will do:
//!
//! * [`load_workflow_union`](crate::company::load_workflow_union) gives the
//!   **seed file precedence** on an id collision, so persisting an overlay edit
//!   for a seed-backed id would store a graph the read path never serves — the
//!   operator's change would appear to save and then silently not exist.
//! * `merge_enabled_workflows` (`src/runtime/builder.rs`, issue #208) rebuilds
//!   `[workflows].enabled` at boot from seed ids ∪ surviving overlay ids, so a
//!   "deleted" seed workflow would come back on the next restart.
//!
//! The same invariant is what makes an overlay delete *durable*: with no overlay
//! body left, the boot merge has nothing to re-enable.
//!
//! ## The version token
//!
//! [`workflow_version`] hashes the stored overlay TOML. `GET …/workflows/{wid}`
//! hands it out, a `PUT`/`DELETE` may hand it back, and the comparison happens
//! **inside** the write lock immediately before the mutation — so it is a real
//! optimistic-concurrency guard, not a check-then-act race. The token is opaque
//! on the wire (the contract is "echo back what the read returned"), so the
//! algorithm can change without a client migration.
//!
//! Passing no token is an unconditional write. That mirrors OpenHuman's
//! `flows_update`, whose `expected_version` is likewise `Option`: it keeps a
//! `curl` caller usable without a read-modify-write dance, while the console —
//! which has a stale-tab problem — always sends one.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately not here
//!
//! * **No revision history.** OpenHuman keeps a bounded snapshot ring in a
//!   dedicated `flow_revisions` table; our overlay bodies live inside
//!   `CompanyRecord`, which is loaded and saved *whole* on every write, so a ring
//!   per workflow would bloat that hot path. It needs its own store surface.
//! * **No run-history reaping.** Past runs are
//!   [`WorkflowRunFinished`](CompanyEvent::WorkflowRunFinished) entries on the
//!   company's single append-only journal, interleaved with chat and audit. What
//!   a workflow did stays true after the workflow is gone, and `GET
//!   …/workflows/runs` keeps serving those rows.
//! * **No schedule re-registration.** Nothing to re-register:
//!   [`WorkflowScheduler::tick`](crate::runtime::WorkflowScheduler) re-reads the
//!   record and re-derives the schedule set from the overlay union every minute,
//!   so the tick *is* a continuous reconcile. OpenHuman needs
//!   `reconcile_schedule_triggers_on_boot` because a bound cron job lives in a
//!   second durable store (`cron.db`) that can drift from `flows.db`; we persist
//!   no registration at all, so that class of bug cannot arise here.
//!
//! # Arming, and the disarm rule (issue #276)
//!
//! A workflow's armed state is
//! [`CompanyRecord::disabled_workflows`](crate::ports::types::CompanyRecord::disabled_workflows),
//! read by [`WorkflowScheduler::tick`](crate::runtime::WorkflowScheduler) and by
//! nothing else that decides whether work happens. Three write paths touch it,
//! and **two of them can only ever disarm**:
//!
//! | Path | Writes |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`create_company_workflow`] | `false`, when the new graph carries a trigger schedule |
//! | [`update_company_workflow`] | `false`, when the edit adds a schedule to a graph that had none |
//! | [`set_company_workflow_enabled`] | whatever the operator asked for |
//!
//! **A schedule is armed only by a person saying so.** That is the rule, and it
//! is one-directional on purpose: an edit that *removes* a schedule does not
//! re-arm anything, re-saving an already-scheduled graph does not re-arm it, and
//! neither does deleting and recreating around it. A rule that could arm would
//! be a rule that could arm by accident.
//!
//! This is OpenHuman's "B29 Rule 1" — its `flows_update` forces `enabled =
//! false` when an edit turns a manual or absent trigger into an automatic one,
//! after a flow of its own started running on an unreviewed 8am schedule — with
//! one deliberate widening. **Create is covered too.** OpenHuman disarms only on
//! edit; here [`create_company_workflow`] is *also* the orchestrator's
//! `create_workflow` tool, so leaving create armed would mean an agent can put a
//! cron into production by authoring one, and an operator who wanted around the
//! rule would only have to write the graph fresh instead of editing it. Issue
//! #276 says it directly: a rule that does not cover create and update together
//! just moves the hole.
//!
//! **Changing an existing cron does not disarm.** `0 8 * * *` → `0 3 * * *` on
//! an already-armed workflow stays armed. The operator accepted automatic firing
//! for this workflow and is now correcting *when*; disarming there would put a
//! re-enable click behind every typo fix, which is how an operator learns to
//! click through the re-arm without reading it. The decision that was reviewed
//! is "automatic at all", and that one has not changed.
